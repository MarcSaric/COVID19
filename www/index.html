This page presents historical SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection
information.  I try to present it in a way that helps inform about how
the virus is progressing throughout the main outbreaks worldwide in a
way that allows countries to be compared and perhaps lessons learned.
The underlying infection and containment processes are complicated,
and conclusions you or I may draw from these graphs are not true
predictions.  For that, you'd need much more data about what is being
done in each country, and about how the data is collected. Comments
are my interpretation only.  Nevertheless, I hope you find it useful.

   <LI> The graph shows <B>number of confirmed cases</b>, plotted on a log
     scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the
     amounts shown.
   <LI>Italy's daily increase rate had been reducing over several days, but then it came back to 15% for three days. Today's increase was 10%, which is promising, but a single data point does not establish a trend.  Yesterday's Lombardy results were higher than I expected, and todays were lower than I expected - I don't know if the increase rate in Lombardy has peaked, but it certainly does not look exponential at the moment..  
     Rates are still increasing in the North East and Central regions. 
  <LI>Over the past two weeks France, Germany, Netherlands and Spain
    all became aligned with the 22 percent daily increase curve
    that Italy followed at this point, rather than the higher 35%
    curve all the large European countries initially followed.
  <LI>The last four days France has shown roughly contant increases;
  if this trend continues, it may be that the daily increases in
  France are peaking now, but I've been deluded by this before.  In
  any event, France has not seen exponential growth for about five
  days.
  <LI>For the last four days the UK has been on the 22% daily increase
  curve, rather than the 35% daily increase curve it was previously
  on.  However, see the UK regional graphs for the wide difference
  between London and the other regions.

<img src="23mar2020/covid-eu-norm.png">
   <UL>
     <LI> The graph shows number of <B>confirmed cases per million inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.  
     <LI> Normalizing by population makes little difference for most of the countries shown.
     <LI> On this view, France's departure from the 22% curve is clearer..
     <LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the
       number of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  The
       Swiss data has been noisy all along, and I'm told testing
       results have seen large delays.  I've moved Switzerland to two
       days behind Italy, but until a new trend becomes clearer,
       I do not have much confidence in this placement.  The dip
       starting a week agolooks similar to what models show when there
       is a step-change in testing methodology, but it appears that
       Switzerland has been tracking below the 22% curve for
       the last week, with the last two increases following Italy at about 14% daily.
       
    <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain is now showing the
    first signs of following Italy onto a lower increase rate but it
    will take a couple more days to confirm this.
   </UL>
<a name="el"><h3>Lombardy, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Confirmed Cases Per Million Inhabitants</h3></a>
<img src="23mar2020/covid-eu-lom.png">
<UL>
  <LI> The graph shows number of <B>confirmed cases per million inhabitants</B>, plotted on a   log scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.  

  <LI>I have aligned the 35% daily increase rate parts of the four
    graphs, so the points at which they diverge can be seen.  As a
    result the graph shows Lombardy as being 5.5 days ahead of Italy,
    but a more realistic value based on today's data points is seven
    days ahead.

  <LI>Four days ago I thought Lombardy had peaked, but unfortunately I
  was wrong.  The last twelve daily increases are 1489, 1445, 1095,
  1865, 1587, 1377, 1571, 1493, 2171, 2380, 3251, 1691.  We are
  looking for a roughly constant daily increase to indicate that we
  are at the inflexion point, after which the number of new cases each
  day starts to decrease.  The data is noisy enough that we cannot
  tell the significance of today's lower increase yet.

  <LI>Switzerland tracked along the 35% curve about six days further
    than Italy did, so comparing with Italy as a whole no longer seems
    to be the right baseline. The Lombardy results provide a better
    new reference curve.  Beware though that these time estimates depend
    on both Lombardy and Switzerland detecting roughly the same
    fraction of cases.  Switzerland is only testing severe cases at
    this point, and Lombardy was clearly overloaded at the same point.
    In both cases it is likely that at least the 10-15% requiring
    medical attention are detected, but there could easily be 2-3 days
    error in these time estimates.  The death rate in Lombardy at this
    point was, however, about four times higher than in Switzerland.
    It is risky to read too much into the death rates, but it might mean that
    Switzerland is counting a larger fraction of infected people than Lombardy
    did at the same point; if so, then Switzerland is further behind
    Lombardy than I have suggested.

  <LI>Austria has been on the 35% daily increase curve, but the last
  five days' increases have been lower. Austria now appears to be
  following the Lombardy curve about ten days behind.

      <LI> The graph shows number of <B>confirmed cases per million
     inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The country
	curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.
      <LI>Data for most Nordic countries shows large waves of
      imported cases, with increase rates above 35%, followed by a
      slump as the imports cease. Sometimes this is followed six or so
	days later by an echo of the original surge.
      <LI>Iceland suffered a large number of imported cases relative
      to its very small population.  After that burst stopped, Iceland
      followed roughly the same curve as Italy, two days ahead.  The last four days, however, Iceland has suffered larger increases, moving back towards the 22% curve.  
      <LI>I will discuss Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland on the
      next graph.  Unfortunately the data no longer looks similar to the South
      Korean curve.

	curves are shown offset by the amounts shown, and the <B>case counts are reduced by the amounts shown.</B>
      <LI> These countries experienced a large wave of imported cases.
      However, it appears they were effective at contact tracing for
      these cases, and most of them were effectively quarantined.
      Despite this, it appears a non-negligible number of local
      infections escaped detection, and from this smaller base,
      exponential growth continued.  I have subtracted the amounts
      shown from the case counts before plotting - these represent my
      guess at the number of imported cases and their immediate
      contacts that were stopped by contact tracing.  If we subtract
      these values, the remaining cases show straight lines at the
      characteristic values of 35% or 22%.  Am I convinced by these
      offset ammounts?  No, not completely - see Norway below.  But this way of viewing
      the data makes more sense to me than the raw counts in the previous
	graphs.
      <LI>Finland appears to have been growing exponentially at 22%
      per day from a base of about 135 active cases eight days ago.
      <LI>Denmark was growing exponentially for seven days at 22% per day
	from a base of about 185 active cases nine days ago.  The last two data points show smaller increases, but it is not yet clear is this is a trend.  
	<LI>Norway appeared to be growing exponentially at 35% per day
	from a base of about 260 active cases five days ago. I'm
	unconvinced by this explanation for Norway, partly because
	four data points is too short to extablish a trend with any
	confidence, and partly because although Norway did suffer a
	burst of imported cases, these appeared in the statistics
	between 11 and 9 days ago, so what happened between then and
	three days ago?  I will continue to monitor and see if this
	  trend continues..
      <LI>Sweden appeared to be growing exponentially at 35% per day
	from a base of about 220 active cases six days ago, but the
	increase rate the last two days has been lower.

      <LI>In Belgium, the inital early ramp-up appears to be mostly
      due to imported cases from Italian ski resorts. Since these
      imports stopped, Belgium seems to be on a similar 22% daily
      increase curve to that followed by Italy
      <LI>For the last eleven days Ireland has tracked pretty closely along the 35% daily
	increase curve and is now further along this curve than Italy reached. 
      <LI>Portugal has followed one day behind Ireland on almost exactly the same track for a while now, and remains on the 35% daily increase curve.  Portugal has also progressed further along this curve than Italy did.
      <LI>Luxembourg has a very small population, so the curve is
      noisy.  However, the last six days data have taken Luxembourg
      well above the point Lombardy reached at this stage of the infection.

<a name="en4"><h3>Estonia, Greece, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Romania, Confirmed Cases Per Million Inhabitants</h3></a>
<img src="23mar2020/covid-eu-norm4.png">
<UL>
  <LI>Estonia's small population and recent fast ramp up of cases
  means it now has a high number of cases per million inhabitants.
  The data is noisy; establishing precisely where Estonia is in the
  progression is difficult as there is no clear stable trend; 
  the current dip may be due to the end of a wave of imported cases,
  as seen in the Danish data, or it may be the first hints of a true decline.
  <LI>Greece and Slovenia both show recent downturns.  It is too early to say, but it is possible both may be seeing the first days of a decline like that of South Korea, or this could be a similar offset exponential effect as seen in Scandinavia.  The curves don't quite match either at the moment, so we will have to wait for more data. In Greece's case, the number of new cases (not the fraction) each day has been relatively constant the last five days.
  <LI>It looks like the Czech Republic had followed Italy onto the 22% daily increase curve.
  <LI>Romania had been following the 35% increase rate line fairly consistently, but has now clearly moved to the 22% daily increase curve that Italy followed.  Yesterday and today's data point are lower, but we need to wait a few more days to see the new trend.
  <LI>Poland remains 21 days behind Italy; I have left it placed  on the 35%
  daily increase curve, though the last two data points show a smaller
  increase.

       <LI>I normally use a log scale on the y-axis because
     exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph.
     This allows exponential growth rates to be compared. However,
     many readers don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
     them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
     It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,

    <LI>London is running around a week ahead of the UK, and is tracking along the curve that Lombardy followed.  Unlike France and Germany, the UK government has been very slow to impose stringent isolation measures, so it is likely London will continue to move along the 35% curve for some time.

     <LI> The early part of the China curve is shown for
     comparison. I'm not sure how accurate the numbers are in the
     early stage because they didn't initially know what to look for,
     and the way of measuring changed part way through this period.
     The initial increase rate is fairly consistent with the 35% daily growth seen in
     Europe.
     <LI>Other than China, South Korea is the only country to have had a
     high sustained increase rate, and then bring the virus under
     control.
     <LI>Iran tracked a little above a 35% increase rate until ten
     days ago.  Since then, Iran had experienced consistent 11.5%
     exponential growth, with the last five days showing further
     decline.  The last five days, the daily increase in cases has
     been roughly constant at around 1100-1200 new cases per day, so
     either Iran may be about to peak, or testing capacity is
     saturated.
     <LI>The USA had been tracking very closely along the 35% growth
     line, then for four days show a move towards the 22% curve Italy
     followed.  However, the last three days have show large
     increases.  Testing in the US has been very limited, so the
     absolute numbers are likely to be undereported compared to other
     countries.  Such under-reporting does not change the inferred
     daily increase percentage, but it does change the timeline.  If
     the number of actual cases in the US is underreported by, say,
     50% compared to Italy, this would move the US 2.5 days closer to
     Italy.  Recently, though, it seems testing has been catching up
     somewhat, although the fraction of tests that are positive has
     been increasing recently in some states indicating that testing
     is again not keeping up with infections.
     <LI>Cases in the US are concentrated in a few states, in a
     similar way to how cases in Italy are concentrated in
     Lombardy.
     <LI>Japan is an enigma.  The testing rate there is low, so cases
     may be being underreported.  However consistently missing the
     same fraction of cases would not affect the exponential growth
     doubling time, which has been extremely consistent at 8.5% per
     day for many weeks.  It seems more likely that early measures
     taken there are being effective at reducing the increase rate,
     but are not sufficient to avoid exponential growth altogether. It
     looks like the combination of early school closure, plus
     ubiquitous face masks and regular Japanese good hygene may be
     responsible for Japan's unique track. No-one really knows,

  <LI> Showing cases per million inhabitants does not greatly change
  the overall picture compared to the previous graph.
  <LI>In this view, the US moves a few days further behind Italy.  This
  is probably deceptive, and it might be better to show data for
  New York State, for example, on this graph.
  <LI>I've added a curve for Singapore, which contained the initial
  imported cases very well.  The graph shows a worrying slow but
  steady super-exponential growth recently though, perhaps indicating
  that current measures are starting to not be effective, or that more
  cases are being imported again.  I've been told that most of the new
  cases are imports; it makes sense that if Singapore's quarantining
  of visitors and contact tracing is mostly keeping on top of local
  spread, then as the pandemic ranges worldwide, Singapore will see an
  equivalent rise in imported cases.  The number of untraced cases remains small at this time.

  <LI>Most US states are a long way behind European countries, but several now have comparable rates per million inhabitants. I have plotted the states with most confirmed cases.
  <LI>Washington is ahead of many European countries, and only roughly five days behind Switzerland.  It is not exactly clear how to place this curve though - European countries moved from 35% daily increase rate to 22% over time. The most recent trend line is lower than 22% and Washington is one of the few states with a decreasing fraction of positive tests, indicating that testing there is growing faster than infections.
  <LI>New York was growing at close to the 35% daily increase rate
  seen in Europe, but has had large increases the last three days.
  This usually happens when cases have been spreading undetected, and
  suddenly testing starts catching up.  I have placed New York based
  on the previous 35% growth phase, but today's datapoint would place
  New York four days behind Italy.
  <LI>Colorado and Florida have been increasing at close to the 35% daily increase rate seen in Europe.  However, <a href="https://healthweather.us/">live digital thermometer data</a> now shows a large number of people there with a fever, so I expect to see a large increase in cases there soon.
  <LI>California shows a slightly lower increase rate, and the data is very clean.  It is possible the slower increase rate is due to warmer weather.
   <LI>New Jersey, Louisiana and Michigan appear to be catching up on testing, so any underlying rate is impossible to determine.

  temperature in Sydney for the five days before March 3rd (17 days
  ago) was 28.6C, whereas for the five days after March 3rd it was
  23.8C.  More analysis is needed to know if this is significant.
  <LI>Malaysia had a large increase four days ago, but since seems to be tracking close to 14%.
  <LI>Brazil seems to be tracking roughly along the 35% line, which seems to run counter to warm weather inhibiting the spread of the virus.
  <LI> Both Qatar and Bahrain have very low recent increase
  levels. This may indicate that most cases were imports, and that
  local spread has been effectivel contained.
  <LI>Although Singapore has a warm climate, I have ommited it from
  this graph, because strong contact tracing there dwarfs any
    climate-dependent effect we might observe.
  <LI> In general, it does appear that COVID19 may spread more slowly in warm climates, but the evidence is inconclusive, with Brazil being the main counterexample.

  <LI> The graph shows number of confirmed cases per million
  inhabitants, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The country
    curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.
  <LI>This graph shows the same warm countries as the previous graph.
  <LI>Australia had been tracking along the 14% curve, but the last few day this has increased to 25% daily increase per day.  Australia has been cooler recent as it moves into Autumn.
  <LI>In general, all the warm country data is quite noisy.  Partly this is due to there being few cases in each country.  All these countries are showing a lower average increase rate to that see in Europe or the US.

<UL>
  <LI> The graph shows number of confirmed cases, plotted on a linear
    scale, against time.  The country curves are shown offset by the
    amounts shown.  In the other graphs I use a log scale on the y-axis because
    exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph, and this makes changes in the growth rates visible and allows exponential growth rates to be compared. However, many
    readers have told me they don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for them.  It
    has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.  It
    doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
    except it looks scarier and shows how much worse things are set to get if effective measures are not taken.
    <LI>I have shown the China curve until the daily increase rate
    drops below 0.1%.  The glitch in the center of this curve is a
    change in measurement methodology.  If Italy follows a similar
    curve, this wave of the epidemic may have abated in 30 days time,
    but this prediction should be tempered by the fact that Italy has
    not quite reached the logistics curve inflection point, though it
    appears to be close.  On this basis, because deaths lag infections
    by 1-2 weeks, the worst is yet to come for many Italian hospitals.

<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<P>
    While you're sitting pondering your mortality, think how astounding it is that one single viral particle from a bat can replicate so far, so fast, and cause so much trouble!  Biology is truly amazing!

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<P><B>Q: Where does the data come from?</B>
<P>Where possible, the data comes from the relevant national
authorities, as they tend to be more up to date.  In some cases I'm
using
the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">WHO
daily briefing</a>, but they lag the national authorities somewhat.

<P><B>Q: Can I have your data?</B>
  <P>My data is <a href="https://github.com/mhandley/COVID19/">on github</a>..
  <P>A more complete dataset is the <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">Johns Hopkins</a> one. It tends to lag the national data sources and the WHO, but it is complete and machine readable.

  <P><B>Q: Can I use your graphs?</B>
  <P>
    Yes, they're under a CC0 "No rights reserved" license.  You can
    use them for any purpose.  I'd prefer you link back here though,
    as the explanations add important context.

  <P><B>Q: Different countries are testing at different rates.  How can you compare the data?</B>
    <P>So long as the fraction of actual cases being detected does
    not change, this does not affect any inference we can make about
    the growth rate.  35% growth is still 35% growth, whether we
    measure 100% of the cases or 50%.
    <P>If, for example, Italy is detecting 50% of the cases and the
    US is detecting 25% of cases, this affects any predictions of how
    far the US is behind Italy At 35% growth, cases double every 2.5
    days, so this undersampling would show the US 2.5 days further
    behind than it really is.
    <P>Likely no-one except Korea and Singapore are getting close to
    100% of cases.  Probably everyone is detecting at least 20% of
    cases, because those require medical attention.  We don't really
    know what fraction of cases are missed, but the difference in
    sampling between countries might skew the delays by a few days in
      either direction.

  <P><B>Q: Comparing with Italy as a whole is flawed. Shouldn't you be comparing with Lombardy?</B>
    <P>Perhaps.  Certainly cases in Italy are concentrated in the
    North at the moment.  Lombardy is running about seven days ahead
    of the rest of the country, as measured by cases per million
    inhabitants. I've shown this in <a href="#g3">graph 3</a>. The
    problem is that cases in some other countries, notably France,
    Spain and the USA, are also concentrated, so comparing these
    entire countries with Lombardy is biased in the other direction.
    These graphs give a crude indication, but they're never going to
    be able to track problems down to the local level, where an
    individual town is overwhelmed by cases before this becomes
    commonplace in a country.  Just remember, to compare with
    Lombardy, a rough approximation is to move the Italy curve seven days
    to the right.
    <P><B>Q: Shouldn't you break out China by province?</B>
    <P> At the moment I'm only showing China on the graphs that show
    absolute counts, not counts per million inhabitants.  As the vast
    majority of Chinese cases were in Hubei, there's not a great deal
    of difference on these graphs between showing Hubei and showing
    all of China.  The population of Hubei provice is around 57
    million, which is roughly the same as Italy.  Thus the data for
    China is reasonably comparable with the data for Italy.
<P>
   The Chinese data is somewhat suspect in the early days, so it's not
   very good for comparison until the epidemic gets a fair way along.
   Mostly I'm using Italy to provide a model for how other places
   might progress, as it's a better fit.  But as of March 16th, I've
   changed the last (linear) graph to use the Chinese data to show one
   possible direction that Italy might folliow.
<P>
   Elsewhere in China, cases that arose were stamped on quickly, and
   pretty much all of China shut down until that was complete.  In
   Europe we failed to learn from that model, so we're all much
   further along than Beijing, Shanghai, or similar provinces ever
   got.
      
  <P><B>Q: Why didn't you show my country?</B>
    <P>A1. Until the number of cases reaches around 100, the data
    tends to be too noisy to draw conclusions
    <P>A2. The graphs are pretty cluttered as it is.  
    <P>A3. I'll add more as I find time.

  <P><B>Q: You aren't an epidemiologist. Why should I listen to you?</B>
    <P>You probably shouldn't.  I'm a computer scientist and I've
    spend decades analysing data, but you should talk to a real
    epidemiologist if you want to understand the underlying causes.
    Computer scientists do know a lot about exponential growth though.
  <P><B>Q: I'm a journalist.  Will you appear on my TV show?</B>
    <P>No. You should have a real epidemiologist on your TV show.
