  <LI>Estonia's small population and recent fast ramp up of cases
  means it now has a high number of cases per million inhabitants. The
  current dip may be due to the end of a wave of imported cases, as
  seen in the Danish data.
  <LI>Belarus and Lithuania have too few cases for the current trend
  lines to be clear.  With the exception of the most recent datapoint,
  they appear to be very roughly following the 35% curve, or a little
  higher.
  <LI>Russia is experiencing a lower daily increase rate than most
  northern countries at the equivalent stage of the infection.  I've aligned it with the 22% daily increase
  curve that many countries followed.
<LI>Latvia also appears to be roughly following the 22% daily increase curve.
