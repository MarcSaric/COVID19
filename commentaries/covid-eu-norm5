  <LI>Estonia's small population and recent fast ramp up of cases
  means it now has a high number of cases per million inhabitants. The
  current curve is similar to the Danish data, where most of a wave of
  imported cases was tracked down and exponential growth resumed from
  a lower base.  The long term trend has been about 10% daily growth.

<LI>Russia is experiencing a lower daily increase rate than most
  northern countries at the equivalent stage of the infection.  I've
  aligned it with the 22% daily increase curve that many countries
  followed.

<LI>Latvia and Lithuania are on very similar curves showing around 10% daily increases.

<LI>Ukraine is growing at around the 35% rate that is typical of countries early in the epidemic.

<LI>I don't understand why the Belarus curve levelled off, but it
increasing again now.  Belarus only reports statistics every two or
three days.
