      <LI>In Belgium, the inital early ramp-up appears to be mostly
      due to imported cases from Italian ski resorts. Since these
      imports stopped, Belgium seems to be on a similar 22% daily
      increase curve to that followed by Italy
      <LI>Ireland and Portugal continue to follow the Italian curve closely, about 12 days behind.
      <LI>Luxembourg has a very small population, so the curve is
      noisy.  However, the last ten days data have taken Luxembourg
      well above the point Lombardy reached at this stage of the
      infection, but the last two datapoints hint at lower increases
      around 22% in the future.  See the next graph for why I am not
      confident Switzerland really is quite so close behind Italy as
      this graph would suggest.
