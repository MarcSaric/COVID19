      <LI>Data for most Nordic countries shows large waves of
      imported cases, with increase rates above 35%, followed by a
      slump as the imports cease. Sometimes this is followed six or so
	days later by an echo of the original surge.
      <LI>Iceland suffered a large number of imported cases relative
      to its very small population.  After that burst stopped, Iceland
      followed roughly the same curve as Italy, two days ahead.  Eight
      days ago Iceland's increase rate increased for five days, but it
      has now levelled off at a similar rate to Italy. It is possible
      that this is due to increased testing rather than a burst in new cases.
      <LI>I will discuss Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland on the
      next graph.  Unfortunately the data no longer looks similar to the South
      Korean curve.
