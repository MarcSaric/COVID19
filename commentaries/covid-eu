   <LI>Italy's daily increase rate had been reducing slowly, and is
   showing signs that it may be peaking (see Graph 3).  Lombardy's
   daily increase rate results appeared to have peaked six days ago,
   though it ticked back up the last two days. If it hasn't peaked, it
   seems like it is close.
  <LI>Over the past two weeks France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Spain
    all became aligned with the 22 percent daily increase curve
    that Italy followed at this point, rather than the higher 35%
    curve all the large European countries initially followed.
  <LI>France,  and the Netherlands appear now to have followed Italy in
    dropping off the 22% curve in the last five or six days, and are more
  aligned now with the 13% curve that Italy followed for about a week.
  <LI>Spain is just starting to shown signs of following the others,
  but only today's update reached 13%, which isn't long enough to
  establish a new trend.
  <LI>For nearly two weeks the UK has been on the 22% daily increase
  curve, rather than the 35% daily increase curve it was previously
  on.  However, see the UK regional graphs for the wide difference
  between London and the other regions.
