<LI>Italy's daily increase rate had been reducing slowly for ten days,
   and appears to have peaked a few days ago (see <a href="#rates">the
   increases graph</a>).  Lombardy's daily increase rate results
   appears to have peaked at the same time.

<LI>Over the past three weeks France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands
   and Spain all became aligned with the 22 percent daily increase
   curve that Italy followed at this point, rather than the higher 35%
   curve all the large European countries initially followed.  

<LI>France, Germany and recently the Netherlands and UK appear now to
   have followed Italy in dropping off the 22% curve in the last week
   and are more aligned now with the 13% curve that Italy followed for
   about a week.

<LI>Spain increased further, faster than the other large European
  countries, and never really aligned with the 13% curve, but in the
  last few days has decreased below the 13% curve, roughly tracking
  Italy's curve, but with a higher caseload at the same point.

<LI>The last three days the Netherlands has started to turn
downwards. It is possible that the Netherlands is now peaking, but if
so, it has done so more suddenly than the countries ahead of it, so I
doubt that this is really the peak.  Another few days will tell.

<LI>Note that I don't have any good justification for why the 35%, 22%
  and 13% curves exist as strong features of the data, but they do
  appear to be quite prominent at the relative phases of the epidemic.
  Likely they are related to various levels of social distancing
  performed by these countries.
