<LI>Certain increase rates: 35%, 22%, 13.5% and 8% really stand out in
  the data, as each country has settled on these rates for a while at
  different phases of the epidemic. I don't have any good
  justification for why these specific increase rates exist as strong
  features of the data, but they do appear to be quite prominent at
  the relative phases of the epidemic.  Likely they are related to
  various levels of social distancing performed by these countries.

<LI>35% daily increase corresponds to a doubling time of 2.5 days</LI>
<LI>22% daily increase corresponds to a doubling time of 3.5 days</LI>
<LI>13.5% daily increase corresponds to a doubling time of 5.5 days</LI>
<LI>8% daily increase corresponds to a doubling time of 9 days</LI>

<LI>On this graph I show the confirmed cases for Western European
countries, with the curves aligned at the point when each had just
transitioned from 35% daily increases to 22% daily increases.  This
view highlights the differences between countries, but is less useful
than <a href="#covid-eu-norm">the next graph</a> for understanding
similarities, so I will reserve dicussion of the individual curves for
that graph.
