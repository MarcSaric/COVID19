<LI>Italy's daily increase rate appears to have peaked around March
   21st and has generally been reducing slowly since then (see <a
   href="#rates">the increases graph</a>).  Lombardy's daily increase
   rate results appears to have peaked at the same time.

<LI>Over the past three weeks France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands
   and Spain all became aligned with the 22 percent daily increase
   curve that Italy followed at this point, rather than the higher 35%
   curve all the large European countries initially followed.  

<LI>France and the UK followed Italy in dropping off the 22% curve 
   and have been more aligned with the 13% curve that Italy followed for
   about a week.

<LI>In the last two days, France has shown a pronounced reduction in
daily increase rate.  France's increase rare recently has been
generally similar to that of Italy just before Italy peaked, but it
will take several more days before we know if France has now peaked
too.

<LI>Spain increased further, faster than the other large European
  countries, and never really aligned with the 13% curve, but in the
  last seven days has decreased below the 13% curve, roughly tracking
  Italy's curve, but with a higher caseload at the same point.
  Spain's increases no longer look exponential; they have been roughly
  constant the last week.  We won't really know for a while yet, but it looks
  if Spain may now be peaking.

<LI>The last five days the Netherlands has started to turn
downwards. It is possible that the Netherlands is now peaking - the
increase rate has stopped increasing for five days now - but if so, it
has done so more suddenly than the countries ahead of it.  Another few
days will tell.

<LI>Note that I don't have any good justification for why the 35%, 22%
  and 13% curves exist as strong features of the data, but they do
  appear to be quite prominent at the relative phases of the epidemic.
  Likely they are related to various levels of social distancing
  performed by these countries.
