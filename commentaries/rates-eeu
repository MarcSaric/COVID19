<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
    changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
    to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>I thought Slovakia had peaked a few days ago, but it appears I was
wrong.  Nevertheless, growth there is almost constant, and certainly
no longer exponential.

<LI>Increase are also roughly level in Bulgaria, which is likely peaking now too.

<LI>Greece appears to be close to peaking - the daily increase has
  been nearly constant for a number of days, and it no longer shows
  signs of significant exponential growth.

<LI> The last two days data for Slovenia and the Czech Republic have
show decreases, but this is too short a duration to have any
confidence they have peaked.

<LI>Serbia, Hungary, Romania and Poland are still growing exponentially with a
relatiively low daily increase rate, though today's data point for Serbia is down.
