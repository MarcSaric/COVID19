<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
    changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
    to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>I thought Slovakia had peaked a few days ago, but it appears I was
wrong.  Nevertheless, growth there is almost constant, and certainly
no longer exponential.

<LI>Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary and perhaps Poland appear to be close to
  peaking - the daily increase has been nearly constant for a number
  of days, and they no longer shows signs of exponential growth.

<LI>Slovenia and Romania are still growing exponentiall, though with a
relatiively low daily increase rate.

<LI>I have added Belarus to this graph, as the curve is intereting.
Belarus definitely seems to have peaked a week ago, though the
absolute values are so small - only 94 cases in total - that only a
small undetected outbreak could reverse this trend.
