  <LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
    changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
    to see whether a country has peaked or not.
  <LI><B>Slovakia appears to have peaked, and Bulgaria may also have done so</B> in the last few days, though a few more days will be needed to be sure.
  <LI>Greece and Slovenia appear to be close to peaking - the daily
  increase has been more or less constant for a number of days, and no
  longer shows signs of exponential growth. Neither has turned
  downwards yet though.
  <LI>Poland and Hungary are still growing exponentially, though the
  absolute values are relatively low.
  <lI>Romania may have peaked, but I'm not confident in this
  conclusion yet - Italy has shown multiple such false peaks.
