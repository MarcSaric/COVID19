<LI>Confirmed cases in the US have been growing very fast recently.
The US testing procedures were very slow to get started, but are
reported to have scaled up quickly.  How much of the rapid increase in
case data is due to this scale-up?  This graph shows the US death
rate, with Italy and France for comparison.  When looking at confirmed
cases, the US is roughly 15 days behind Italy, whereas when looking at
death rates, the US is roughly 19 days behind Italy.  This probably
indicates that a small part of the recent increases is indeed due to
improved testing, but the difference is nowhere near as large as
Germany or Luxembourg, so the underlying infection rate must also be
high.  If this gap widens in the future, then this would be evidence
  that testing is getting ahead of the epidemic.
  <LI> To put this in perspective if Italy is identifying just the ~10% of infections that need ICU care, the US is probably identifying very roughly ~30% of infections. (1.35 ^ 4 ~= 3)
