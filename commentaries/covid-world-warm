  <LI>Most warm countries do not have enough cases to establish a clear
  increase rate trend.  The graph shows number of confirmed case for
  some typical "cool" countries and some "warm" ones.  

<LI>Malaysia, India, Bahrain, Kuwait and Egypt are all warm countries and have all been experiencing
    roughly 14% daily growth.

<LI>Australia used to be on the 14% curve, but ten days ago it
  switched to the 22% curve.  The results from ten days ago correspond
  to infections from roughly 17-20 days ago.  The mean daytime
  temperature in Sydney for the five days before March 3rd (17 days
  ago) was 28.6C, whereas for the five days after March 3rd it was
  23.8C.  More analysis is needed to know if this is significant.
  There is no equivalent warming associated with the most recent
  reduction in daily growth, so this is likely to be related to social
  distancing measures.

<LI>Malaysia had a large increase four days ago, but since seems to be tracking close to 14%.

<LI>Brazil was tracking roughly along the 35% line for a while, which
seems to run counter to warm weather inhibiting the spread of the
virus, but recently it has moved to lower growth.  I have now aligned
Brazil with the 14% curve experience by other warm countries, though
the fit is imperfect.  Brazil actually has both tropical and
equatorial climate zones, so it clear how this should manifest in
COVID-19 progression.

<LI> Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait have very low recent increase levels. This
  may indicate that most cases were imports, and that local spread has
  been effectively contained.

<LI>Although Singapore has a warm climate, I have omitted it from this
  graph, because strong contact tracing there dwarfs any
  climate-dependent effect we might observe.

<LI> In general, it does appear that COVID19 may spread more slowly in
  warm climates, but the evidence is inconclusive, and it appears to
  require relatively hot temperatures to have much effect.
