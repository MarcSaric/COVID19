  <LI>Very few warm countries have enough cases to establish a clear
  increase rate trend.  The graph shows number of confirmed case for
  some typical "cool" countries and some "warm" ones.  During the
  timescale shown, Spain had experienced cool weather.
  <LI>Malaysia, India, Bahrain, Kuwait and Egypt are all warm countries and have all been experiencing
    roughly 14% daily growth.
  <LI>Australia used to be on the 14% curve, but ten days ago it
  switched to the 22% curve.  The results from ten days ago correspond
  to infections from roughly 17-20 days ago.  The mean daytime
  temperature in Sydney for the five days before March 3rd (17 days
  ago) was 28.6C, whereas for the five days after March 3rd it was
  23.8C.  More analysis is needed to know if this is significant.
  <LI>Malaysia had a large increase four days ago, but since seems to be tracking close to 14%.
  <LI>Brazil seems to be tracking roughly along the 35% line, which seems to run counter to warm weather inhibiting the spread of the virus.
  <LI> Both Qatar and Bahrain have very low recent increase
  levels. This may indicate that most cases were imports, and that
  local spread has been effectivel contained.
  <LI>Although Singapore has a warm climate, I have ommited it from
  this graph, because strong contact tracing there dwarfs any
    climate-dependent effect we might observe.
  <LI> In general, it does appear that COVID19 may spread more slowly in warm climates, but the evidence is inconclusive, with Brazil being the main counterexample.
