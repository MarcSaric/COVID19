<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better
to see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>Daily increases in absolute numbers have been nearly constant for
several days in Finland and Iceland.  This is likely to an indication
that the infection rate in these countries is peaking, though we won't
be sure until it has been going down again for more than a week.
Certainly, exponential growth is no longer occurring in these
countries.

<LI>Norway was growing exponentially until 26th March, but since then
has been decreasing. Four days is not long enough to have confidence
that Norway has peaked, as daily change data is always noisy, but it
hints that it might have done so, especially given relatively good
news from similar countries elsewhere in the Nordic region.

<LI>Denmark and Sweden have very similar exponential increase rate
profiles for the last two weeks. Neither country is yet showing signes of peaking.

<LI>In mid March, Estonia looked like it had peaked, but this behaviour
has happened in other countries such as Denmark, where a large number
of case are imported.  The imported cases are mostly tracked down,
leading to a dip, then growth again as transmission that was missed
grows.  The peak seven days ago be an echo of the original
imported peak - this happened in Denmark and Sweden too, though their
echoes were less pronounced.  Today's data point is higher; It is too early to know if the curve
will continue  up again, but the Denmark curve implies this is
possible in Estonia too.
