      <LI> These countries experienced a large wave of imported cases.
      However, it appears they were effective at contact tracing for
      these cases, and most of them were effectively quarantined.
      Despite this, it appears a non-negligible number of local
      infections escaped detection, and from this smaller base,
      exponential growth continued.  I have subtracted the amounts
      shown from the case counts before plotting - these represent my
      guess at the number of imported cases and their immediate
      contacts that were stopped by contact tracing.  If we subtract
      these values, the remaining cases show straight lines at the
      characteristic values of 35% or 22%.  Am I convinced by these
      offset amounts?  No, not completely - see Norway below.  But this way of viewing
      the data makes more sense to me than the raw counts in the previous
	graphs.
      <LI>Sweden appeared to be growing exponentially at 35% per day
	from a base of about 220 active cases six days ago, but a
	sudden change to a 16% daily increase rate occurred five days
	ago.
      <LI>Finland appears to have been growing exponentially at 22%
      per day from a base of about 135 active cases nine days ago.  The last three days hint that a change to a lower increase rate similar to Sweden's 16% has occurred.
      <LI>Denmark was growing exponentially for seven days at 22% per
	day from a base of about 185 active cases nine days ago.  The last four days Sweden seems to have moved to a lower increase rate similar to Sweden.
	<LI>Norway appeared to be growing exponentially at 35% per day
	from a base of about 260 active cases six days ago. Norway
	also appears to have switched to a 16% daily increase the last
	few days.
