<LI>Turkey and Israel both appear to be tracking faithfully along the path blazed by Italy.

<LI>Until a week ago, Saudi Arabia was seeing 22% daily increases.  A
week ago there was a sudden change, and the last week, daily increases
have been averaged around 10%.
  
<LI>Pakistan initially saw very rapid rises, but the last eight days
has seen exponential increases with a substantially longer doubling
time.

<LI>I don't understand the South Africa data.  The very sudden change
from exponential growth at 35% per day to less than 5% growth seems
unlikely to reflect a real change in underlying infections.  No other
country has shown such a sudden change from one day to the next.
