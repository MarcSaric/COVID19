<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better to
see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>The daily increase in cases appears to have peaked in both
Lombardy and in Italy as a whole around March 21st.

<LI>Switzerland appears to be on a plateau, which may be a sign than it is peaking.

<LI>Spain, France and the UK all hint at peaking today.  From
comparing the cumulative curves, I'm not yet convinced any of these
countries is actually peaking.  I would expect France to not peak for
another week and the UK to not peak for nearly two weeks.  There's no
clear model for Spain, so it may be peaking already, but two days of
decline is insufficent for me to have any confidence.

<LI>The very rapid increase rate in the US appears to have tailed off,
but I suspect it has some way to go before peaking.

<LI>Greece shows no clear pattern recently; the trend seems to be for
slow but not exponential growth.
