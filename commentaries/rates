<LI>Generally, trends are easier to see on a cumulative plot, as
changes are inherently more noisy.  However, this view is better to
see whether a country has peaked or not.

<LI>The daily increase in cases appears to have peaked in both
Lombardy and in Italy as a whole around March 21st.

<LI>Switzerland appears to be on a plateau, which may be a sign than it is peaking.

<LI>Spain, Austria, the Netherlands and the UK all hint at peaking the
last few days.  From comparing the cumulative curves, I'm not yet
convinced any of these countries is actually peaking.  I would expect
the UK to not peak for nearly two weeks.  There's no clear model for
Spain, so it may be peaking already. Today's Spanish data point was
higher than yesterday's but the trend has been level for five days.
Of the four, Austria looks the most likely to have peaked, but it will
require a few more days to be confident in this.

<LI>The very rapid increase rate in the US appears to have tailed off,
but I suspect it has some way to go before peaking.
