 <LI>In the other graphs I use a log scale on the y-axis because
    exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph, and this makes changes in the growth rates visible and allows exponential growth rates to be compared. However, many
    readers have told me they don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for them.  It
    has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.  It
    doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
    except it looks scarier and shows how much worse things are set to get if effective measures are not taken.
    <LI>I have shown the China curve until the daily increase rate
    drops below 0.1%.  The glitch in the center of this curve is a
    change in measurement methodology.  If Italy followed a similar
    curve, this wave of the epidemic may have abated in 30 days time,
    but this prediction should be tempered by the fact that Italy has
    not quite reached the logistics curve inflection point, though it
    appears to be close.  On this basis, because deaths lag infections
      by 1-2 weeks, the worst is yet to come for many Italian hospitals.
   <LI>One thing this view shows well is how much of an outlier the US
   is - the faster increase rate of the US
   curve is self-evident.  The US exceeded both China and Italy's
   case counts today.
<LI>This view also makes clearer the recent restart of exponential
  growth in Iran.  It is unclear to me whether exponential growth
  actually had previously stopped in Iran, or whether the increase
  rate was simply limited by their testing capacity.  If it was the
  latter, then something about their process for confirming cases has
  changed.
