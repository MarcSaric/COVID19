     <LI> The early part of the China curve is shown for
     comparison. I'm not sure how accurate the numbers are in the
     early stage because they didn't initially know what to look for,
     and the way of measuring changed part way through this period.
     The initial increase rate is fairly consistent with the 35% daily growth seen in
     Europe.
     <LI>Other than China, South Korea is the only country to have had a
     high sustained increase rate, and then bring the virus under
     control.
     <LI>The USA had been tracking very closely along the 35% growth
     line, and has done so for much longer than any other
     country. Testing in the US was initially very limited, but
     recently it seems testing has been catching up somewhat. In the
     last few days the US has shown the first signs of dropping off of
     the 35% daily increase curve.
     <LI>Cases in the US are concentrated in a few states, in a
     similar way to how cases in Italy are concentrated in
     Lombardy.
     <LI>Iran tracked a little above a 35% increase rate until three
     weeks ago.  Since then, Iran had experienced ten days of
     consistent 11.5% exponential growth, with the last ten days
     showing further decline.  For many days the daily increase in
     cases had been roughly constant at around 1100-1200 new cases per
     day, but it has now started to increase again.  It is possible
     this was due to limitations in testing.
     <LI>Japan is an enigma.  The testing rate there is low, so cases
     may be being underreported.  However consistently missing the
     same fraction of cases would not affect the exponential growth
     doubling time, which had been extremely consistent at 8.5% per
     day for many weeks, until the last week when it has declined
     further.  It seems more likely that early measures taken there
     are being effective at reducing the increase rate, but are not
     sufficient to avoid exponential growth altogether. It looks like
     the combination of early school closure, plus ubiquitous face
     masks and regular Japanese good hygene may be responsible for
     Japan's unique track. No-one really knows,
     but <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/03/21/commentary/japan-commentary/japan-still-coronavirus-outlier/#.XnZH06FRUlQ">many
     are speculating.</a>
