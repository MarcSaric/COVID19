<LI>All the English regions converged onto the 35% daily increase
curve that Italy followed, then transitioned to the 22% daily increase
curve, though London and the Midlands spend longer at 35% than the
other regions.  Since then, all the regions have seen further reductions.  I have aligned all the regions except South West directly with the Italy curve, as that all appear to be decreasing is a similar manner to Italy.

<LI>South West is the exception here, as the daily increase rate there
has been less than the rest of England for more than a week now.

<LI>London is running around a week ahead of the UK, and is tracking
along the curve that Italy followed (previously it looked like it was
tracking the Lombardy curve).  London is looking like the daily
increase rate there may peak within the next week.
