  <LI>I am now pulling data for this graph from
    the <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">NYT
    dataset</a>, which is much less noisy than the JHU dataset I was
    previously using.
  <LI>Most US states are a long way behind European countries, but
    several now have comparable rates per million inhabitants and New
    York is ahead. I have plotted the states with most confirmed
    cases.
  <LI>European countries moved from a 35% daily increase curve to a
    22% daily increase curve; Washington is one of the few US states
    to have clearly made a similar transition, and in the last few
    days the daily increase rate has declined further.  Washington is
    the only US state with a large number of cases to start to turn
    the tide significantly.
  <LI>New York was growing at close to the 35% daily increase rate
    seen in Europe, but then had very large increases over a week.
    This usually happens when cases have been spreading undetected,
    and suddenly testing starts catching up. The last few days, cases
    in NY have been growing exponentially at around 22% per day.  This
    is the same growth curve most European countries followed once
    people started to get concerned about COVID19.  I have placed New
    York so as to align it with the 22% curve.  This places it 4 days
    offset from Italy, but today's datapoint would place New York
    above Italy.  As Italy seems to have peaked and New York has more
    cases per head of population than Italy, it makes no sense saying
    where New York is on Italy's track: New York is forming its own
    track.
  <LI>Illinois and California are the other two states that are now
    following the 22% curve.  California has followed the curve for
    some time, but Illinois has only recently come out of fast growth
    (presumably due to testing catching up somewhat) so we will have
    to wait and see it it stabilizes along this curve.
  <LI>New Jersey, Louisiana, Michigan, Colorado, Florida, and Texas
    have been increasing recently at close to the 35% daily increase
    rate seen in Europe, so I've placed then on that curve, though
    this gives misleading time delays relative to Italy.  Based on the
    most recent data point, New Jersey is 12 days behind Italy.
