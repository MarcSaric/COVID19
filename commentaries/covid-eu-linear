       <LI>I normally use a log scale on the y-axis because
     exponential growth gives a straight line on a log-linear graph.
     This allows exponential growth rates to be compared. However,
     many readers don't like log-linear graphs, so this one is for
     them.  It has to be truncated, or you cannot see any information.
     It doesn't really show anything additional over the log graphs,
     except it looks scarier.
