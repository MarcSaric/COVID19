  <LI> Showing cases per million inhabitants does not greatly change
  the overall picture compared to the previous graph.

<LI>In this view, the US moves a few days further behind Italy.  This
  is probably deceptive, and it might be better to show data for
  New York State, for example, on this graph.

<LI>I've added a curve for Singapore, which contained the initial
  imported cases very well through contact tracing.  However the graph
  shows a worrying slow but steady super-exponential growth until
  about a week ago.  This growth was due in part to contact tracing
  losing its effectiveness, and recently Singapore announced more
  isolation measures as the number of untraced cases was rising.

<LI>I have added a curve for Australia, which appears to be in the
early stages of peaking.  If this continues, the curve will continue
to curve downwards to eventually parallel the Korean curve.
