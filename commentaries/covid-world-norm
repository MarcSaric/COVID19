  <LI> Showing cases per million inhabitants does not greatly change
  the overall picture compared to the previous graph.
  <LI>In this view, the US moves a few days further behind Italy.  This
  is probably deceptive, and it might be better to show data for
  New York State, for example, on this graph.
  <LI>I've added a curve for Singapore, which contained the initial
  imported cases very well.  The graph shows a worrying slow but
  steady super-exponential growth recently though, perhaps indicating
  that current measures are starting to not be effective, or that more
  cases are being imported again.  I've been told that most of the new
  cases are imports; it makes sense that if Singapore's quarantining
  of visitors and contact tracing is mostly keeping on top of local
  spread, then as the pandemic ranges worldwide, Singapore will see an
  equivalent rise in imported cases.  The number of untraced cases remains small at this time.
