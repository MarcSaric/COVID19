  <LI>I have aligned the 35% daily increase rate parts of the four
    graphs, so the points at which they diverge can be seen.  As a
    result the graph shows Lombardy as being 5.5 days ahead of Italy,
    but a more realistic value based on today's data points is seven
    days ahead.

  <LI>Lombardy now appears to have peaked, though I won't be sure of
  this for a few more days.  See Graph 3.  The daily increase in cases
  is today was roughly the same as ten days ago, with a peak five days
  ago.

  <LI>Switzerland tracked along the 35% curve about six days further
    than Italy did, so comparing with Italy as a whole no longer seems
    to be the right baseline. The Lombardy results provide a better
    new reference curve.  Beware though that these time estimates
    depend on both Lombardy and Switzerland detecting roughly the same
    fraction of cases.  Switzerland is only testing severe cases at
    this point, and Lombardy was clearly overloaded at the same point.
    The death rate in Lombardy at this
    point was, however, about four times higher than in Switzerland.
    It is risky to read too much into the death rates, but it might
    mean that Switzerland is counting a larger fraction of infected
    people than Lombardy did at the same point; if so, then
    Switzerland is further behind Lombardy than I have suggested.  THe
    death rate curves in the previous graph certainly suggest this may
    be the case.

  <LI>Austria has been on the 35% daily increase curve, but the last
  five days' increases have been lower. Austria now appears to be
  following the Lombardy curve about ten days behind.
