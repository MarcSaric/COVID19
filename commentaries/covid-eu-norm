<LI> In constrast to graph 1, which highlights any divergence, on this
graph I'm showing these countries aligned with the 13.5% curve as all
of them now appear to have left the 22% curve.

<LI> France, Germany and Spain have all been tracking along the 13.5%
daily increase curve that Italy followed.  In the last two days all
three countries appear to be starting to drop below the 13.5% curve,
though it will take a few more days to be sure.

<LI> Italy has now dropped off of exponential increases and the daily
increase count 
appears to have peaked.

<LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown two days behind Italy and followed Italy closely for the
    last two weeks.  Switzerland appears to be very close to peaking, but has not
    yet clearly done so.
    
  <LI> See the <a href="#deaths-eu-norm">this death rates graph</a> for why I am
    not confident in this placement for Switzerland - it appears that
    Switzerland is testing more widely than Italy, so Switzerland is
    likely to be perhaps as much as 10 days behind Italy.
    
  <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain only roughly aligned
    with the 13.5% curve, although it joined this curve at roughly the
    point where Italy departed it, and in the last two days appears to
    have left this curve too.  The increase rates graph implies Spain
    may have peaked, but if so, it will be a more rapid peaking than
    Italy did, so it is equally likely that the current dip will be
    transient.  In any event, if Spain has not yet peaked, I would
    expect it to do so in the next week.
