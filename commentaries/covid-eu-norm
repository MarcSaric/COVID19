  <LI> The graph shows number of <B>confirmed cases per million
    inhabitants</B>, plotted on a log scale, against time.  The
    country curves are shown offset by the amounts shown.
  <LI> Normalizing by population makes little difference for most of the countries shown.
  <LI> On this view, France's departure from the 22% curve is clearer.
  <LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown two days behind Italy and has followed Italy closely for the
    last week.
  <LI> See the <a href="#end">this death rates graph</a> for why I am
    not confident in this placement for Switzerland - it appears that
    Switzerland is testing more widely than Italy, so Switzerland is
    likely to be perhaps as much as 10 days behind Italy.
  <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Althouh Spain has now
    moved to a lower daily increase rate, it has not followed Italy
    and France down to 13%.
