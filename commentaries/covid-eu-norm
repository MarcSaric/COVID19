<LI> In contrast to graph 1, which highlights any divergence, on this
graph I'm showing these countries aligned with the 13.5% curve as all
of them now appear to have left the 22% curve.  I'm also showing a shorter time interval.

<LI> France, Germany and Spain were all been tracking along the 13.5%
daily increase curve that Italy followed.

<LI>In the last five days Germany has dropped below the 13.5% curve, with roughly constant daily increases.
It will take a few more days to be sure whether we are seeing early signs that Germany too has peaked.

<LI> Italy has now dropped off of exponential increases and the daily
increase count appears to have peaked.

<LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown two days behind Italy and followed Italy closely for the
    last two weeks.  Switzerland appears to be very close to peaking, but has not
    yet clearly done so.
    
  <LI> See the <a href="#deaths-eu-norm">this death rates graph</a> for why I am
    not confident in this placement for Switzerland - it appears that
    Switzerland is testing more widely than Italy, so Switzerland is
    likely to be perhaps as much as 10 days behind Italy.

  <LI> For 13 days now, Switzerland has seen roughly constant daily
  increases, which suggests Switzerland may be peaking.  The
  alternative explaination - that testing capacity is saturated -
  doesn't seem to match with what we see in the death rates curve, so
  I think the Swiss cases data is likely reasonably good.
    
  <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain only roughly aligned
    with the 13.5% curve, although it joined this curve at roughly the
    point where Italy departed it, and in the last four days appears
    to have left this curve.  The increase rates graph implies Spain
    may be peaking, but if so, it will be a more rapid peaking than
    Italy did, so it is possible that the current leveling will be
    transient.  In any event, if Spain has not yet peaked, I would
    expect it to do so in the next week and at a daily case increase count
    not far above the current one.
