<LI> I'm now showing these countries aligned with the 13.5% curve as
all of them now appear to have left the 22% curve.  

<LI> France, Germany and (tentatively) the UK are all now tracking
along the 13.5% daily increase curve that Italy followed.

<LI> Italy has now dropped off of exponential increases and appears to have peaked.

<LI>Switzerland has a relatively small population, and so the number
    of cases per million inhabitants is much higher.  Switzerland is
    shown two days behind Italy and has followed Italy closely for the
    last two weeks.
    
  <LI> See the <a href="#deaths-eu-norm">this death rates graph</a> for why I am
    not confident in this placement for Switzerland - it appears that
    Switzerland is testing more widely than Italy, so Switzerland is
    likely to be perhaps as much as 10 days behind Italy.
    
  <LI>Spain stayed at 35% daily increases for much longer than any
    other large European country, which caused it to close on Italy,
    then followed the 22% curve for a week. Spain is now tracking
    along the 13.5% curve, although it joined this curve at roughly
    the point where Italy departed it.
